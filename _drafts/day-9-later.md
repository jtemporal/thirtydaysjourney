Dear diary,

You see?! This is why I usually take Sundays to rest!

I'm usually tired of the week. Especially today, I woke up early and with that scary feeling because I overslept and had on-call procedures to deal with.

But okay, I won't duel on them too much. It's a waste of energy.

The practice wasn't that good today.

I found it was challenging to find my balance. But I tried. After all, it is _practice_ and not perfection the goal here. Am I right?

The plan is to go to bed as soon as I post this and wake up refreshed tomorrow.

See you tomorrow, maybe in a better mood, lol.

Namaste! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
