Dear diary,

I'm still tired, but not exhausted.

Here's a tip: get the blood pumping, and some of the tiredness goes right out of the window.

I know it won't last long, mostly because dinner will be risotto and wine!

But other than that, yay! 7- days completed!

In today's e-mail, Adriene said: "you should feel proud, Jessica," and guess what?! I do!

Past year me wouldn't believe this would happen.

Future year me will be grateful that it did.

Now dinner and a glass of wine🍷 and prepare for the weekend.

Here's to hoping for a sunny morning tomorrow! 🥂

See your next practice!

Namaste! 🧘‍♀️ <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
