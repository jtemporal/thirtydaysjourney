Dear diary,

Adrienne isn't human. There will be a class named "burn," and I already feel the burn going on. Oh, Lord, please have mercy.

I thought it would be hard to focus on the practice today, but I must say, it wasn't. Maybe being aware that my thoughts were running wild helped?! This was interesting to notice.

Also, ocean breath! What a treat! I feel that adding sound to breathing helped a lot to guide the breath through the pose transition, a thing that I usually struggle with. It is noticeable how ujjayi breath actually aids you to ground your thoughts to the moment.

And even though some progressions were challenging today (oh, that burn), I feel energized and calm.

Ready to tackle all of the work I have planned for today!

See you tomorrow!

Namaste!!!
