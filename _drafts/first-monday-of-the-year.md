Dear diary, the first Monday of the year is here. ðŸŽ‰

Woke up doing "the list", you know? The list you prepare mentally of all things you have to do on that day? I've been kinda trying not to think about that list the whole day yesterday.

It took a lot of strength not to think about it, to be honest.

This week will be a long week at work â€” many systems to update and features to deploy.

Because I woke up thinking about all the things I have to do this week, I'm even considering doing today's practice after work is over. Still, at the same time, considering all the things I have to work on, this might not be the best idea.

I also think that there's a change that will be tough to focus on the practice because my mind keeps racing back to work.

Funny thing, though.

I thought I would be worried and anxious to get back to work after the holidays. Instead, I think I'm happier to get back to work after all this time than anything else.

See you at the practice!

Namaste!
