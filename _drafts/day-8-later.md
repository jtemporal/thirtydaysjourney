Dear diary,

What a snuggly practice!

I grabbed two small pillows and one fluffy blanket and brought them to the mat with me! And, oh, girl, what a great idea!

I think all of my savasana from now on will have pillows and blankets.

It's just _too good_ to simply not use them!

I don't know what that "diamond" pose is called, but I had fun doing it! All I kept thinking was, "Look! No hands, no hands!!".

Week 2 yurt started, and I can see it is going to be fun!

See you tomorrow!

Namaste! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">

Ps.: Found out that "diamond" pose is actually called [_"Blossoming Lotus"_](https://www.tummee.com/yoga-poses/blossoming-lotus-pose), lovely, huh? It is close a second close place to my favorite pose of all times, the [_"Pigeon pose with forward bend"_](https://www.tummee.com/yoga-poses/pigeon-pose-forward-bend)_._
