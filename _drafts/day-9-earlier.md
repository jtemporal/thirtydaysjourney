Dear Diary,

Sunday is here again, and with it, my willingness to got to the mat goes to -10 degrees.

All I want to do is stay on the couch and being watch some series.

But I am strong, and I'll show up for myself.

To the mat, we go!

See you after practice.

Namaste! 🧘‍♀️ <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
