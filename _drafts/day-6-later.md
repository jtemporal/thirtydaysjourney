Dear diary,

The doubts about Adrienne being some sort of undercover amazonian warrior are growing. Thank the goddess, she knows we (mere mortals) need breaks.

The funny thing about today's practice: I never thought a breathing technique could make my muscles burn.

Breathe of fire.

I felt the burn alright.

But I gotta say, somehow, even though the practice was fiery, I finished it very happy.

Took a few breaks.

Let out some loud laughs here and there and got to the end of it all happy for being able to move.

Happy to do something different every day.

Looking forward to tomorrow and grateful for today.

See you at the next practice.

Namaste! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
