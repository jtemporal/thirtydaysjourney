Dear diary,

Day 13 is here! I even woke up without nightmares today (context: I woke up to nightmares 2 days in a row)! 🎉

Decided to do yoga before the first meeting today and maybe enjoy it a little bit more than yesterday.

See you after practice.

Namaste! 🧘‍♀️ <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
