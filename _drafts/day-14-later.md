Dear diary,

This is going to be a long one. So get ready.

Adriene prompted us to write how we feel as we arrive at half of the journey. And well, I started this diary to talk about this.

For sure, I can feel my body getting stronger as days go by.

I also noticed that I've been calmer than before. And somewhat more in control of my feelings since I can get back to my breathing when I need it.

This journey also gave me something to look forward to every day. It also is responsible for adding a bit of variety in this Pandemic where all days seem more of the same.

I can't wait to see what the next 18 days hold.

See you tomorrow!

Namaste! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
