Dear diary,

As you know, I did my yoga at the end of the day today. And let me say: it was gooooood!

I had a great day at work, finished a complex task today, and started a second one.

I managed to work well today, even though this means I also worked a lot. But I feel good, got in [the flow](https://www.coderhood.com/15-best-ways-to-achieve-flow/).

I'm happy I also managed to do most full planks today; I usually do them knees down as I'm still working to build core strength.

I even got to do a little of that down dog with the twist! Who'd guess that I'd be brave enough to even try it?!

As I finish my day, the only thing I feel is grateful.

Grateful for how my tasks progressed nicely at work.

Grateful that I can feel my body getting stronger day by day.

I even managed to read a few pages of [Sheryl Sandberg's book Lean In](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B009LMTDL0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). A gift I got from my friend [Leticia Portella](http://leportella.com/) and a must-read for all genders!

Right now, I feel that I can conquer the world!

But, I think I'll leave conquering the world for tomorrow morning. And just go to bed.

Namaste! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
