Dear diary,

There's something kinda great about doing yoga with recently done nails. I think I took extra time looking at my feet placement, which has its advantages.

After yoga, I went down to the gym for a little walk.

This was a great Saturday.

See you tomorrow.

Namaste! 🧘‍♀️ <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
