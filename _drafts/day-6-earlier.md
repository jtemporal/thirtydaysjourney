Dear diary,

Day 6 is here, and I decided to do yoga later today and sleep in. I was pretty tired from yesterday's, well, everything. And I'm glad I did.

I woke up today, feeling rested and relaxed.

Also, today is _burn_ day!

I think this matches the warm weather from earlier. Now imagine my surprise as I got out of the last of today's meeting to a summer storm outside. Thank you, noise-canceling! I always get distracted by the sound of rain falling outside.

Today I also received new yoga pants I bought via the internet the other day, and they fit like a glove. I feel like a million bucks at the moment.

So let's go to the mat with the hope of clear skies after the storm!

See you after practice!

Namaste! 🧘‍♀️ <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
