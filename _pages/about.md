Hi, my name is Jessica, and I'm a data scientist; this means most of my days are spent sitting and facing a computer screen looking and analyzing data.

I'm also a yoga passionate, and ever since my first class a few years ago, I've been connected to yoga. Even though I stopped practicing it for a while last year (2019), I decided to go back, and here we are.

This site is my diary about yoga, at least for the next 30 days, when I'll be following Adriene's 2020 "30 days yoga journey" I'll gather my thoughts and feelings on the posts you'll see here.

Namaste! 🧘‍♀️
