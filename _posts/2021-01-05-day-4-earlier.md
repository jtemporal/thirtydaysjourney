Dear diary,

Today I'm _s l o w_.

It took me a while to get out of bed- and it is taking even more time to actually start the day.

Considering how slow I am today, I still manage to have a good breakfast, which is nice.

At 11:30, I'll have my first meeting of the day- and right now is 10:16, and yep. Nothing is done yet!

But it is okay, some days we start slow. Plans for the day:

\- get butt out of the sofa and stop watching Toronto videos

\- do yoga

\- finish the task I started yesterday at work

\- go to the gym for a little treadmill walk

\- make dinner

\- do a little knitting

\- sleep

Sounds good, huh? See you later.

Namaste! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
