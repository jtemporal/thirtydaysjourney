Dear diary,

I have so many things going on my mind right now that I don't even know where to start.

Okay, let's begin by, well, the beginning...

I laid down my mat, grabbed my blocks, set the iPad to the side, and pressed play.

Today's class starts with a moment for breathing. Well, this is a journey focused on breathing, no surprises when the first class invites you to breathe. üòä

I gotta say, my breathing isn't my strongest skill. I think this is partially due to many years of swimming classes. When you do swimming classes, you learn to inhale as deeply as possible as _fast_ as possible.

Thus, I always find myself struggling to take deep, slow breaths. Especially when I have to do it in sync with some movements. Throughout the class, I found myself taking short inhales then moving a little. I hope to improve this breathing situation in the days to come.

It was interesting to notice these breathe-move dynamics and, better yet, to have time to work on this.

Focusing on the breath also made progressing through the poses more comfortable. I also had time to find some alignment adjustments. As Adriene said, "find nuance", every body is different, and it is important to take your body into account.

For instance, today, my hips were really tight, and it took me a while to arrive at my usual hip release. Nothing like a few low lunges to help the hips slowly open.

It's no surprise I finished the practice feeling more connected and happier.

The sun is out today, and the day is getting warmer.

I think I might stop by the pool later.

And will definitely add that hand massage to my before-bed routine.

That's it for the day, see you tomorrow.

Namaste! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
