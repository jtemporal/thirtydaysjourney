Dear diary,

Today was the shortest class yet. And it was just what I needed today. To slowly start the day and listen to my body.

Adrienne tailored these classes pretty well.

I talked to Ana a little bit about this after the class. So far, all practices matched my mood for that day, almost like the classes were custom-made for me.

After class, I felt in a slow vibe still but with more energy.

I can't wait to see what it will be like tomorrow's class.

Namaste! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
