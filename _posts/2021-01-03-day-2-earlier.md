Dear diary, today is one of those hard days.

You wake up before the alarm. The sun is already high, and

you don't want to get out of bed. You want a lazy Sunday.

Then all you hear is that little voice: "_you committed to showing_

_up, get your behind out of these cozy blankets and take this_

_one step at a time. you can do it!_"

And you take a while to listen to that voice, but you get

up and take a deep breath as you stretch, hands to the ceiling, sending the sleepiness away.

Yup. Today was one of these mornings.

I got up. Made some coffee, checked the on-call boxes at the computer. Sat down with my mug and took a while to feel the caffeine taking effect.

Turned on the clothes washing machine and grabbed the iPad to start this page. All I kept thinking was, "_why did I have to start this?_". Instead of starting writing, I decided to check whether Adriene's e-mail with today's practice had arrived.

To my surprise - ok, maybe not so much considering all of Adriene's communication so far - today's e-mail was meant for _me_!

Ok, I know this sounds cheesy, but it is true! It was the right amount of encouragement. It spoke to my doubting self.

Particularly, in one line, she wrote:

"_Some days your brain **will** make it very hard for you to arrive, and it may seem like the exterior is winning over your interior goals._"

And trust me, today, that's exactly how I feel.

But I'm set in my goal to show up. And taking a moment to get these thoughts out helped calm my inner thoughts.

I feel better now and ready to go to the mat. Did I mention it's a beautiful sunny day out?

See you after practice.
