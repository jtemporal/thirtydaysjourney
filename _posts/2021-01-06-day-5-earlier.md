Dear diary,

Guess what?!

Yep, I changed yoga time today. I always preferred to exercise at night because it helps me get rid of accumulated energy, release the day's tension, and sleep easier.

But I had many things to do at work today, and it gave my mind some peace to start work earlier instead of doing yoga.

As a result, I managed to fix the broken pipelines I was working on, and finish my working day happy that I got things done.

Right now, I'm sitting on my mat while my partner plays Ghost of

Tsushima on PS4. And I feel the most calm I've been in a couple of days.

See you after practice.

Namaste! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
