Today we have our first practice, and I'm really excited about this beginning.

You see... I love the beginning of things, to learn new stuff. There's a saying: _"Be brave enough to suck at something new"_. Last year was the ukulele. This year will be the daily yoga practice.

The morning started with the usual weekend routine: on-call procedures, checking that the systems didn't fail over night, then breakfast.

Don't you clone the smell of fresh coffee and cheese bread in the morning?!

I know I do!

By the way, yesterday, the hatha yoga practice was on point. Finished the day feeling the legs a little sore from using my muscles to something other than being on the sofa all morning.

It's a sunny day out, the sky is blue, and I can hear the birds outside.

Soon I'll lay my mat on the living room floor, but first, breakfast.

Namaste! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
