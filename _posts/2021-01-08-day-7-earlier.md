Dear diary,

Not much to declare today,

Other than that, I had an earlier than usual start at work today, which prevented me from doing yoga earlier than usual.

And had a long day too.

It is 5:30 pm right now, and I finally got a break, and I sat down to do my practice.

I hope that after practice, I feel less exhausted.

See you on the mat.

Namaste! 🧘‍♀️ <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
