Dear diary,

My Saturday is going great!

I woke up, made pancakes, had an excellent breakfast with my significant other.

Then we spent one hour in the pool, got a few laps in, then soaked in sunlight. It was nice and warm, a perfect summer day.

Then we ordered lunch, and after a while on the sofa, we got to the gym for a little treadmill.

And here I am, at the mate with my fluffy blanket, ready to snuggle with Adriene, Benji, and everyone that is going through this journey too!

See you after practice!

Namaste! 🧘‍♀️ <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
