Dear diary,

Yoga was great! Today's session Reminded me of a practice I love called

[_"Morning Yoga"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p27vpEU962w) from Useful Yoga series with Steffy.

It was a great flow to indeed connect with myself, and it matched my mood after a day full of intense meetings.

I even got a little time on the treadmill after the practice.

At the moment, I feel I could run a marathon.

I am looking forward to the next practice.

See you tomorrow.

Namaste! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
