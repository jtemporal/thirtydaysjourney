Dear diary,

Today is planning Monday.

Every two weeks, we make a video conferencing day and figure out the priorities for the upcoming two weeks of software development and maintenance.

This whole day of planning guides our work. This is also a very tiring day, mainly because we try to list all the tasks we plan to do for the upcoming weeks.

It also means that I spent the whole day sitting without my usual breaks and that I'm in need of some serious stretching.

That's why I was looking forward to the end of the day. To do some yoga and shrug off some of the built-up tension.

See you after practice.

Namaste!
