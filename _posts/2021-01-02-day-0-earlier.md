Dear diary,

This will be my diary for the next 30 days. And yes! I plan to begin every post with _"Dear diary"_.

So, yesterday [Ana Schwendler](https://twitter.com/anaschwendler) invited me to this [_"30-days YOGA journey"_ by Adriene](https://do.yogawithadriene.com/breath-30-day-yoga-journey). You know we've been supporting each other since we had met back in 2017. First, has it been this long already???

We worked together on the Serenata de Amor project, and our friendship flourished from many video conferences.

And here we are. I must say, 2020 wasn't easy.

We faced our own challenges, but one thing that stuck with us was our almost daily check-in with each other's health and fitness journey.

You see, last year was complicated, but to decided to keep doing yoga, we could fit the practice in our hectic daily schedule. And best yet, we only needed a little space in our apartment to do it.

Our favorite app to keep up with our practices is [Yoga by Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com/). Their set of values match ours and also provides both a challenge and something to share.

We would send prints of the practice done to each other over [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) whenever we did one.

Practicing yoga has brought Ana and me even closer, even though it has been more than a year since we actually saw each other. It has strengthened our friendship. When Ana sent me the link, the only thing I could say was: LET'S DO THIS! üéâ

Today is day 0 of the 30-days journey, and we are committing to show up to our mats for the next 30 days. We can, and we will.

To make this experience more complete, I de¬≠cided to make a diary.

I'll write down how I'm feeling and how things are progressing for me.

I _hope_ this will help me realize how much I improve and better connect with my body.

I'm also hoping to make more intense use of my gadgets to help out on this.

All of my notes will be handwritten entries on [Notability, an app from GingerLabs](https://www.gingerlabs.com/), then converted to text. All of this will happen on my 2020 11 inch iPad Pro and will be made with Apple Pencil 2.

Adriene (the yoga instructor) will post each class on youtube, so I'll use the [YouTube app](https://www.google.com.br/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjl9pGF9_vtAhV6DrkGHV15Cj8QFjABegQIAhAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fbr%2Fapp%2Fyoutube%2Fid544007664&usg=AOvVaw3o68oZM5V6tI4sS-HdZ8bA) to watch the videos and follow along using my Airpods 2.

I'll also log every practice on my workout app on Apple Watch 6. Gotta close those rings, am I right?!

So let's go to the first class!

Namaste! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
