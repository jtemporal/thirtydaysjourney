Dear diary,

First of all, it took me a while to write this entry, but it was for a good reason!

I finished today is practice right on time to get a quick shower and running back to the computer.

But the choice to do yoga was a great idea!

I'll try to keep the shorter practices in the mornings for sure!

Looking forward to the next practice.

See you tomorrow!

Namaste! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <img width="25%" height="25%" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jess-signature.gif">
